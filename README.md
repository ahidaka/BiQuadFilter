# BiQuadFilter
Open source BiQuad Filter source, generated by GitHub copilot.

This is an open source BiQuadFilter project.
I contributed articles to technical magazines to disseminate the knowledge and know-how I gained from my experience developing Windows audio drivers (APO).

When writing this article, I came up with the idea of experimenting with gain control and audio equalizer control as themes that are easy for anyone to understand and experiment with. However, I could not find the BiQuad Filter source code with clear handling of licenses, intellectual property rights, and source code. So I asked GitHub Copilot to generate the source code for me. To my surprise, this code worked perfectly without any debugging from the moment it was written.

The entire source code is included in Windows Driver Samples, which is released under a Microsoft license, so it can be found below.
